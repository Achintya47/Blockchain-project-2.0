# Blockchain-project-2.0
The blockchain is hostable on a local network connected via Wifi or Ethernets via a switch.
Read the  "Edits for different devices" File once and make the necessary changes in different devices or nodes.
Libraries to be installed:
  Simple run this in your terminal : python -m pip install threading multiprocessing 
Also you would need to setup your device's network config accordingly( I will release a complete guide soon!)
